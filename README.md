The project's main goal is to computerize a company's data management. It takes the place of all paper work. It maintains and ensures that the computerized boat reservation system is implemented successfully 100 percent of the time. There are three modules in this reservation system. The first module assists the customer in determining the availability of seats on a specific boat. The second module assists him in confirming a ticket reservation. He can cancel a reserved ticket using the third module.
